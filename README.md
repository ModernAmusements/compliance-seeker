# Compliance Seeker

Compliance Seeker is a web application designed to test websites for cross-border data transfer compliance. The application checks if websites transfer personal data outside of the EU without adequate safeguards, and looks for instances where data is sent to countries without an adequate level of data protection or without the use of appropriate mechanisms such as Standard Contractual Clauses or Binding Corporate Rules.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14.x or later recommended)
- npm (v6.x or later recommended)

### Installing Dependencies

1. Navigate to the project root directory.
```bash
cd path/to/compliance-seeker
```

2. Install the necessary dependencies.
```bash
npm install
```

## Running the Application

1. Navigate to the project root directory if you are not already there.
```bash
cd path/to/compliance-seeker
```

2. Start the Next.js development server.
```bash
npm run dev
```

The application should now be running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). You can access it in your web browser.

## Starting the Backend Server

1. Navigate to the `backend` directory from the project root.
```bash
cd backend
```

2. Install the necessary dependencies if you haven't already.
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the backend server.
```bash
node server.mjs
```
   - Alternatively, if you have set up a script in your `package.json` to start the server, you can use that instead. For example, if you have a script named `start`, you would run:
```bash
npm start
```

Now the backend server should be running on [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001). It's ready to handle requests from the frontend part of the Compliance Seeker application.
